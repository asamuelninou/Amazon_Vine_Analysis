# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
Our goal is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Their are approximately 50 datasets of different products, from clothing apparel to wireless products. 

## Analysis
Analyzing the Vine Reviews, I found:

There were 268 Vine Reviews to 29,517 Non-Vine Reviews. There were 149 Vine 5 Star Ratings to 13,675 Non-Vine 5 Star Ratings. The percentage of 5 Star Non Vine reviews is: 55.6% of the Vine ratings were 5 Stars and 46.33% of the Non-Vine ratings

## Summary
Although Amazon takes pride in its Vine program for reviews, this analysis raises a question of bias. Although the sample sizes vary drastically, the percentage of 5 Star ratings is nearly 10% higher coming from Vine reviewers. The difference in sample size may not account for the differece in 5 Star ratings.

### Future Analysis

1) A T test to compare the Vine reviews and the non Vine reviewers
2) Comparing summary statistics on Star Ratings
3) Tokenizing the review texts and comparing the Star Ratings for every reviewer
